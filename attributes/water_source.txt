a coastal harbour
a calm, coastal bay
a large freshwater lake
a wide, navigable river
a small river navigable my small craft
the mouth of a river
the confluence of two rivers
a series of natural springs
a seemingly endless ancient well
an immense waterfall
a natural runoff from the nearby mountains
a well-travelled crossroads
